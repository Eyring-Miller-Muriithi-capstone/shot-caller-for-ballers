    "### Question: [Exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet) are planets outside of our solar system and we're entering a new era of exoplanet discovery with the [James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) coming online.  Expanding on the Kepler telescope and a number of other telescopes/missions geared towards exoplanet discovery, the JWST will allow humanity to glimpse further into the unverse than ever before; but, it can also get amazing detail of things much closer.  In fact, under certain conditions, it can 'see' an extrasolar planet's atmosphere, possibly detecting telltale signs of life.  As such, with so many stars in our galaxy alone (~100 Billion) and assets limited to one telescope, can we identify stellar candidates that have 'Earthlike' planets to focus our attention on?  INCLUDE HERE THE 'WHY'!  EXPECIALLY IF YOU CAN INCLUDE A SMALL LITTLE GRAPH SHOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS IN 3 POINT SHOOTING\n",
    "##### Note: For this study, I defined 'Earthlike' as planets that have a gravity level that could support earth-like life, as this will present the most familiar signs of organic activity for identification .  Details of how this was determined can be found in this notebook. \n",
    "### Actions: Using [exoplanet telescope data consolidated by CalTech](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/), I attempted to filter and identify key characteristics of stars with earthlike planets - with the goal of identifying planets which would most likely harbor detectable life.  As such, I did a detailed analysis of the best data I could put together on every planet so far discovered to see if there were any clear drivers of having earthlike planets.  Modeling was attempted to see if an ML Classification Model could be used to classify new and existing stellar candidates.\n",
    "### Conclusions:  Even with extensive analysis, there was not much success in identifying clear characteristics of stars which harbor Earthlike planets.  Modeling also failed to improve on baseline.  Overall this is not surprising as this is a very new field stretching cutting edge instruments to their furtherst capabilities.\n",
    "### Recommendations: Continue to cluster stellar characteristics in an attempt to find one statistically signifigant as an indicator of Earthlike planets.  Also, an imputing algorithm can be used to capture a number of planets that had nulls that could not be filled simply by combing and finding the mean of all available data for that planet.  Lastly, focus early JWST studies on building a dataset which allows for modeling the likelihood of a star having an earthlike planet, as this will make it a better tool in the long run by continually improving its targeting."
